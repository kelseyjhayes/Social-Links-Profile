## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The initial development of this design was relatively straightforward. It was good to be able to practice media queries, using a mobile first workflow. 


### Continued development

Something I'd like to continue working on is my understanding of responsive positioning, particularly for smaller sized screens. I'm able position elements on desktop screens well, but I run into issues when the screen size is smaller than the size of the element (e.g. if the length of a phone is smaller than the length of a container element).
